mrclmr Homebrew Tap
===================

This is a [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) tap for casks and formulae for software developed by mrclmr.


Setup
-----

Using these casks or formulae requires Homebrew, which in turn requires Xcode. If you
have not yet installed Homebrew, a quick summary is at the end of this
document.

Once homebrew is installed, simply run:

    brew tap mrclmr/tap
